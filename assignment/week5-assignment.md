Hallo All,


Week 5 group assignment will be on practicing with visualization and mapping. You can use a combination of the following libraries

- dplyr
- ggplot2
- GISTools
- sf
- sp
- rgdal
- rgeoms
- gridExtra
- grid
- tmap


You will do the same steps that we learnt in class for Singaporean spatial dataset that saved in [https://github.com/namkyodai/2022-UrbanComputation-SUTD/notes/sg-gis](https://github.com/namkyodai/2022-UrbanComputation-SUTD/tree/main/notes/sg-gis)

- Visualize the map in different way using variable Population
- Adding points data --> choose POIs from many folder under GEOSPATIAL.
- Adding line data --> you need to collect by yourself the road dataset from Singapore.
- Performing some simple calculations for area and length
- Adding a dataset for centroid of polygons and visualize it using either bubbles or points layers with tmap library.

# SPECIFIC DATASET for each group

## Group 1
- For polygons dataset --> use **planning-area-census2010-shp** and other folders on residents Population by planning area.
- For POIs --> use any of POIs dataset under folder GEOSPATIAL starting with letter A and end with letter L. For example, A is ArrowMarking_May2017 and L is LaneMarking_May2017. Note that you can decide to choose other POI dataset from other sources.
- For Line dataset --> kindly collect from the internet relevant road networks or water distribution networks.

## Group 2
- For polygons dataset --> use **subzone-census-2010** and other folders on residents Population by subzone
- For POIs --> use any of POIs dataset under folder GEOSPATIAL starting with letter P and end with letter W. For example, P is ParkingStandardsZone_May2017 and W is WordMarking_May2017. Note that you can decide to choose other POI dataset from other sources.
- For Line dataset --> kindly collect from the internet relevant road networks or water distribution networks.


## Presentation time
Presentation time for each group is about 10 minutes. Other members of the groups should present instead of members who presented for week 3 assignment.


## Important notes

- If you have any issue, pls go to and post issue [https://github.com/namkyodai/2022-UrbanComputation-SUTD/issues](https://github.com/namkyodai/2022-UrbanComputation-SUTD/issues) so I or other members of the class can address timely and all of us can see the solutions

- You can also upload your solutions under issue

Cheers

Nam
